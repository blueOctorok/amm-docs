## Create Project

Use the React template to give you the front end boilerplate. Use Vite if you want to do it better, but not follow along with the video.
Just download and don't clone it. Then you don't have to worry about removing the origin.
Then grab the `package.json` from the finished project.
Do this because this project has a lot of old dependencies and `hardhat` has made changes to the methods used now.
